<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Simple" icon="seti:todo">
    No build steps, no complicated configuration. The fluent interface allows you to model complex structures, while
    maintaining great code readability.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Performant" icon="rocket">
    Great care has been taken to ensure that parsing is fast. Data copying is reduced to the absolute minimum. An
    extensive benchmarking suite prevents performance regressions.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Safe" icon="seti:lock">
    No dynamic code execution means that you can parse in a strict content security policy environment.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Versatile" icon="list-format">
    An extensive collection of built-in schemas is provided, allowing you to model a large variety of complex types,
    including recursion.
  </Card>
