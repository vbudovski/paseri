title: "Messages"
---

In order to support localised error messages, each parsing error produces a unique error code. This is then looked up in
the messages object for the selected locale. When calling the `messages` method on either the `safeParse` result or the
exception thrown from `parse`, you can pass the desired messages object as the parameter. The default messages can be
found in `locales/en.ts`.

## Contributing new translations

You can copy the definition of the closest language to the one you are targeting as a starting point, if one exists.
If there isn't a suitable starting point, please create a new file. Be sure to follow the TypeScript type `Translations`
to ensure all standard messages are handled. The naming of the file should follow the pattern `<language>-<country>`,
where the language is a 2-letter [ISO 639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) code, and the
country is a 2-letter [ISO 3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) code. For example, `en-GB` or
`pt-BR`.

# Custom error codes

You can extend the messages object to add your custom error codes and corresponding translations.

```typescript
import { en } from '@vbudovski/paseri/locales';

const enCustom = {
    ...en,
    ...{
        foo: 'This is a `foo` error.',
        bar: 'This is a `bar` error.',
    }
} satisfies Translations;
```
