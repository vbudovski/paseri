## The usual way

Before we get into using the Paseri library, let's try to fetch some [Pokémon data](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon)
using a typical TypeScript approach.

```typescript
interface Pokemon {
    name: string;
    height: number;
    weight: number;
}

async function getPokemon(name: string): Promise<Pokemon> {
    const response = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${name}`);
    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`Failed fetching ${name}.`);
    }

    return response.json();
}

const bulbasaur = await getPokemon('bulbasaur');
console.log(bulbasaur.name, bulbasaur.height, bulbasaur.weight); // OK.
```

This isn't bad. We've asserted that the fetch response contains `Pokemon` data, so we can use it without any extra type
assertions, and with the benefit of auto-completion in the editor. In a perfect world, this might be fine, but APIs
change, and developers make mistakes.

## The better way

Rather than assume that the data we get from the endpoint is what we expect, we're far better off validating that it is.
We can create a schema that will guarantee that the data we receive from the endpoint has the exact structure we need,
and have it generate the TypeScript type for us!

```typescript
import * as p from '@vbudovski/paseri';

const pokemonSchema = p.object({
    name: p.string(),
    height: p.number(),
    weight: p.number(),
});

interface Pokemon extends p.Infer<typeof pokemonSchema> {
    // Identical to the interface we created above.
}
```

Now that we have our schema, we can make the `getPokemon` function validate the response.

```typescript
async function getPokemon(name: string): Promise<Pokemon> {
    const response = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${name}`);
    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`Failed fetching ${name}.`);
    }

    const data = await response.json(); // `any` type.

    return pokemonSchema.parse(data); // Now it's `Pokemon` type.
}

const bulbasaur = await getPokemon('bulbasaur');
```

Run the code above. Does it work?

:::note
Objects are validated in strict mode by default. This means that unrecognised keys will result in a parsing error, and
helps to catch unexpected changes to an API.
:::

You'll see a long list of unrecognised keys in the error message. This tells us that our assumption about the endpoint
response is incorrect. We can fix the error by modifying our schema to include the missing keys. For now though, let's
just strip them. Update the `pokemonSchema` above to look as follows:

```typescript
const pokemonSchema = p
    .object({
        name: p.string(),
        height: p.number(),
        weight: p.number(),
    })
    .strip(); // This will sanitise our data.

const bulbasaur = await getPokemon('bulbasaur');
console.log(bulbasaur); // { height: 7, name: "bulbasaur", weight: 69 }
```

Our data is parsed successfully, and all the other keys have been removed. We can now access the data with confidence,
knowing that the structure is exactly as we expect it to be.

:::tip
It's generally better to parse objects in strict mode, as it catches errors that might otherwise have been missed. The
full list of options can be found in the [reference](/reference/collections/object/).

Now that you've had a taste of what Paseri can do, you can explore the full [API documentation](/reference/schema/).
Happy parsing!
